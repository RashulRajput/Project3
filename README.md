Auction Contract
Overview
This is a decentralized auction contract built on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to place bids on an item, and the highest bidder wins the auction. The contract also allows the owner to withdraw the highest bid and cancel the auction.

Features
Decentralized: The auction is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity.
Transparent: All bids and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making the auction process transparent.
Secure: The contract uses Ethereum's smart contract technology to ensure that the auction is secure and tamper-proof.
How it works
The owner creates an auction and sets the initial bid.
Users place bids on the item, and the highest bidder wins the auction.
The owner can withdraw the highest bid at any time.
The owner can cancel the auction at any time.
Contract Functions
placeBid(uint _bid): Places a bid on the item.
withdraw(): Withdraws the highest bid.
cancelAuction(): Cancels the auction.
